                            The above image represents a painting I made during my freshman year of college. I attempted to copy the Jaws poster, though it didn't turn out as good as I hoped. But, this memory is dear to me because it represents good times with my friends from high school. It showed us that even though we were miles apart and didn't talk as often, we'd still always be close.

                        <p>The above image represents a DIY terrarium I made at The Zone with my roommates. Again, it isn't particularly artistic in its entirety, but it has a lot of beautiful components combined together. Furthermore, this was such a great memory for me and my roommates, since we had such a great time just relaxing and making art together.</p>
