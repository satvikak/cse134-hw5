            <!-- Project Card 1: Climate Pattern Prediction -->
            <my-project 
                title="Climate Pattern Prediction"
                description="In this project, I worked on predicting climate patterns by participating in a Kaggle competition, where I placed in the <b>top 25%</b> with a score of 0.9398. I built and improved a deep learning model using <b>U-Net with attention mechanisms</b> to predict climate data over time and space. I tested the model's performance by comparing it to different architectures like <b>CNNs, DenseNet, ResNet, and U-Net variations</b>, aiming to find the most accurate model. I also used data visualization techniques to display where the model was making errors, which helped improve its performance further."

            <!-- Project Card 2: Green Lens - AI Climate Argument Retrieval Engine -->
            <my-project
                title="Green Lens - AI Climate Argument Retrieval Engine"
                description="For this project, I was part of a 4-person team that built a real-time system to search for climate science articles based on specific user queries. The system used <b>FastAPI, Streamlit, and OpenAI's GraphRAG architecture</b> to power the search engine. I helped develop the retrieval pipeline, using advanced techniques like <b>BERT+FAISS, BM25, and TF-IDF</b> to ensure the articles retrieved were relevant and fast. We achieved a relevance score of 0.78 and managed to keep query response times under 7 seconds, making the tool both effective and efficient. dditionally, I worked on automating the process of generating citations and summarizing key points from the articles to make the system more user-friendly and scalable."

            <!-- Project Card 3: Restaurant Simulator -->
            <my-project
                title="Restaurant Simulator"
                description="In this project, I worked with a team of 4 to create a fully functional restaurant simulation using C++. We designed a system where users could simulate restaurant operations, including managing tables, orders, and servers. I helped implement the system using <b>Agile development and object-oriented design principles</b>, ensuring the software was organized and easy to scale. We used unit testing with <b>GoogleTest</b> to ensure all parts of the system were reliable, achieving 100% code coverage and robust functionality. I also played a key role as both a developer and the <b>scrum master</b> of the team. I helped coordinate meetings, encourage good communication between team members, and ensured that all the different modules of the system fit together smoothly."
